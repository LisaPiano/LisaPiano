- 👋 Hi, I’m @LisaPiano, and I'm currently a piano professor!
- 👀 I’m interested in computers, html, css, javascript, and programming. 
- 😍😍 Right now, I'm almost done with the TrueCoders certificate in Software Development! I'm also on the 12th unit of the Team Treehouse frontend techdegree. I have also learned a great deal from W3 and Free Code Camp. I love to learn and am hoping to relocate and find a junior level position.
- 🙌I love praticing with CodeWars.
- 📫 How to reach me: you can email me at lisacampiwalters@gmail.com
