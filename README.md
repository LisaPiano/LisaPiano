- 👋 Hi, I’m @LisaPiano, and I'm currently a piano professor!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning all about computers, html, css, javascript, and programming.
- 😍😍 Right now, I'm on the 8th unit of the Team Treehouse frontend techdegree. I also love Free Code Camp and plan to use more of their recources. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning getters and setters in javascript. I hope to begin learning about React soon.
